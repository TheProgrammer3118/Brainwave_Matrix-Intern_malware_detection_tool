# Advanced Malware Detector Tool ‚úàÔ∏èüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview
The Advanced Malware Detector Tool is a comprehensive Python application designed to detect and manage potential malware on a user's system. Utilizing machine learning and file analysis techniques, this tool offers both basic and advanced scanning options for files and running processes. It aims to enhance your cybersecurity by identifying malicious activities and providing options for remediation.

## Project Details
This project includes several key features:

- **Model**: The detector employs a Random Forest classifier, trained on a synthetic dataset, to classify files as malicious or safe.
- **Scanning Capabilities**: 
  - It scans specified directories for malicious files based on file extensions and machine learning predictions.
  - It checks running processes for known malicious activity.
- **Remediation Options**: Users have the ability to remove detected malware files.
- **Logging**: The tool logs all activities and detections for future reference, ensuring transparency and accountability.

## How to Use
To utilize the Advanced Malware Detector Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** or download the necessary files to your local machine.
2. **Install the required libraries** by running:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil joblib scikit-learn
Train the model if it hasn‚Äôt been pre-trained. Execute the training script: python train.py
This will create the file malware_classifier.pkl, which is essential for the scanner.
Run the malware detector by executing: python malware_detector.py
Follow the on-screen menu to perform scans, remove malware, or exit the application.
